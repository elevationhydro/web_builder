# A Typescriptified MEVN application boilerplate 
This is a work in progress.

## TLDR
Mongo - Express - Vue - Nginx

Express and Vue both have Typescript baked in, which because we are waiting on Vue3.0, means that `vue-class-component` is standing in until we get Vue 3

You'll need Mongo installed and running

This repo is basically an Express API App with the its auth 90% completed and a Vue SPA - glued together using some .sh and other adhesives

And this is where the opiniation begins...

This is also where I state.. 

## As Is Where Is

This is a handy repo for me, so maybe it can be handy for you as well. The use case is when you want to use the MEVN stack and typescript front and back, and dont want to spend time writing days of plumbing.

That being said, I've been steadily building this environment for a few years, so while it may seem straight forward to me, it may seem like either a complete rats nest or total overkill to you...
